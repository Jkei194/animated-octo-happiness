# LSTM prediction on S&P 500
Segmented Strategy Optimization for S&amp;P 500 and Stock Prediction Techniques

# Prediction of S&P 500 by LSTM model and segmented strategy
Under comparative experiment, we oberserve frequent trading leads to loss in return rate.
Therefore, our team member propose a even segmented strategy with higher return rate than a normal LSTM model.
The return rates are determined by a backtest function.

Check it out on our code "Final_project_stockprediction.ipynb"!
